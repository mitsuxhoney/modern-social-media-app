# Modern Social Media App

## Technologies Used:

### React JS
Harness the power of React JS, a declarative and efficient JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows us to create reusable UI components and manage the state of our application efficiently.

### Appwrite
Fueling the backend of our social media app is Appwrite, an open-source backend server that simplifies the development of web and mobile applications. Appwrite handles user authentication, real-time updates, and data storage, providing a robust foundation for our platform.

### Tailwind CSS
Style meets simplicity with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Tailwind allows us to rapidly build a modern and responsive user interface without sacrificing customization. The result is a sleek and visually appealing design that adapts to various screen sizes seamlessly.

### React Query
Optimizing data fetching and state management is made effortless with React Query. This library enables us to fetch, cache, and update data with minimal boilerplate code, enhancing the overall performance of our application. React Query seamlessly integrates with React components, making it a perfect fit for our dynamic social media platform.

### Infinite Scroll Functionality
Our social media app goes beyond the conventional by implementing infinite scroll functionality. Say goodbye to pagination as users seamlessly explore content with automatic loading as they scroll. This feature ensures a fluid and continuous browsing experience, keeping users engaged and immersed in the content flow.
